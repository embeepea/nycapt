This directory contains geojson file(s) of neighborhood boundaries.  The data
in these file(s) came from:
    git@github.com:embeepea-scratch/Zillow-Neighborhoods.git
which is a fork of
    git@github.com:ningliang/Zillow-Neighborhoods.git

I stumbled onto the above repo by googling "new york neighborhoods shapefile", which turned up a hit on the page

   Zillow Neighborhood Boundaries - Zillow Website Tools [http://www.zillow.com/howto/api/neighborhood-boundaries.htm]

which in turn has a link to

   New York Neighborhood Boundaries [ http://www.zillow.com/static/shp/ZillowNeighborhoods-NY.zip ]

but that link is dead.  So I then googled "ZillowNeighborhoods-NY.zip", which turned up the above github repo.

google and github rock!
